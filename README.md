### **Web + Mobile System Design**  
#### Assignment C: Pure Css Motion
#### By Feng Yuan  
---
This is a motion collection made by pure css.  
In this case, sass provides the possibilities to make my work non-repeatable. By using some goodies of Sass, like variables, mixins, and for loop, I can make the style sheets more “super functionality”. This also truly saves the coding time.  
Here is the reference and tutorial I used for this assignment.
